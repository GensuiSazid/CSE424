# CSE424 — Pattern Recognition

## 📘 Course Overview
**Pattern Recognition** focuses on the theory and algorithms that enable computers to automatically classify data into meaningful categories. The course introduces both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques for analyzing patterns in diverse data forms such as text, images, and signals.

Students learn to extract features, build models, and evaluate classifier performance. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using Python.

## 📚 Course Description (from University)
> Pattern recognition techniques are concerned with the theory and algorithms of putting abstract objects, e.g., measurements made on physical objects, into categories. Typically the categories are assumed to be known in advance, although there are techniques to learn the categories (clustering). Methods of pattern recognition are useful in many applications such as information retrieval, data mining, document image analysis and recognition, computational linguistics, forensics, biometrics, and bioinformatics.

> Much of the topics concern statistical classification methods. They include generative methods such as those based on Bayes decision theory and related techniques of parameter estimation and density estimation. Next come discriminative methods such as nearest-neighbor classification, support vector machines. Artificial neural networks, classifier combination and clustering are other major components of pattern recognition.

## 🧩 Course Project

### 🧠 Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Through Pattern Recognition
Developed a machine learning framework to detect early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease using MRI brain scans. Implemented **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** models for multi-class classification across dementia stages.  
The **SVM model achieved 99% accuracy**, outperforming CNN (90%) and Random Forest (92%). Data preprocessing involved normalization, segmentation, and feature extraction to highlight regions linked to neurodegeneration.  
This project demonstrated the potential of AI and pattern recognition in medical imaging and early diagnosis.
